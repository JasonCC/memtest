Memory test suite v0.0.4
------------------------

This intends to be a set of programs to test the memory management
system.  I am releasing this version with the idea of gather more
programs for the suite.  If you have some program to test the system,
please send it to me (quintela@fi.udc.es).

Thanks to Tom Hull and Arjan van de Ven for fixing the C++ warnings.

If you found values/combinations of tests for what the system
crash/Oops/whatever please report it to me.  Then I can include it in
the tests and the people who tune the MM system can test it next time.

This version has:
        An improved README
        new shm test
        removing several compilations warnings
        added Tests file
	Now RAMSIZE is a parameter that you can change at runtime
        	test <size in megabytes>  (this patch has been done by 
	        Marcelo Tosatti <marcelo@conectiva.com.br> and then
                extended by me)

Any comments/suggestions/code are welcome.

This tests can be made possible thanks to the collaboration of:
	Conectiva <http://www.conectiva.com/>
	LFCIA (my University group) <http://www.lfcia.org>
that kindly donated to me an SMP machine.

Thanks for your time,
