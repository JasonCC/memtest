This file describes several commands than generate a great load in your system.

Kernel compiles:
        make -j bzImage

        It will generate a *big* load


Bonnie test:
        make -s <big file>
        This is a file system benchmark

/proc test:
        this test is from: Alexander Demenshin <aldem-linux@aldem.net>

  $ top -d0     # Yes, with _no_ delay.
  
  Sure it will Oops even with -d1, but with -d0 it will do so quickly :)
  
  On the another console:
  
  $ find / -xdev -type f | xargs -n1 -P100 md5sum --
  
  After short time (it depends) it will crash. BTW, after Oops it is nearly
  impossible to shut system down, however it will function for some time.
  One or several processes that are running will be impossible to kill,
  and attempt just to 'cd /proc/<pid>' on some of processes will block the
  process doing 'cd' (which also becomes unkillable).

A memory tester: memtester.sh
  I have get that from the  Doug Ledford web page
  <http://people.redhat.com/dledford/>.
